# AQUARIUM

An aquarium simulation using a dynamic map

## Rules

Fishes can be spawned at anytime.

The fish stats are health, speed, hunger, egg-laying period, egg hatching period, its attack radius.

A fish can be either feeding on algua or other fishes.

When a fish's hunger goes above 80 percents, it starts losing health.

When a fish's hunger goes below 20 percents, it starts regaining lost health.

Fishes reproduce asexually for the moment. Fish reproduction shenanigans are hard to code.

Algaes appear as dots on the map. They have limited life-time, and they appear  in random locations slowly

When a fish lays an egg, it becomes hungrier by 30 percents.

A fish needs to have less than 30 percents in hunger to be able to lay an egg.

# TODO

Make a better algorithm for the fish.

"Flap" style moving would be super cool.
